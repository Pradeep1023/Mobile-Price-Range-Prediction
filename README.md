# Mobile-Price-Range-Prediction
In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. So I have built a multiclass model which will help in predicting the price range of phones based on their features.Different classification techniques have been applied on the dataset to get the best possible prediction.

1. Did data cleaning on some features.

2. Performed Exploratory data analysis on discrete and continuous features of dataset.

3. Performed feature engineering on some features.

4. Applied 6 machine learning classification algorithms i.e,
Logisitc Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Tree with Cross-validation
Random Forest Classifier
XG Boost
K-Nearest Neighbors
Support Vector Machine Classifier

5. Hyperparameter tuning was performed on model using GridSearch CV
6. XG Boost and SVM performed best among these algorithms with test accuracy score of 91%
